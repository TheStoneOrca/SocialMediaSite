When you first clone this repositroy. Make sure you install the required dependinces in the backend AND frontend folder using npm i. Then fill out the pg information using your information. (if hosting on pc, make sure to have PostgreSQL installed). After you fill that information out, make sure to use the SQL file to insert the tables and database information into your database so everyone works perfectly. After you've set everything up, run npm start for frontend and node/nodemon Main.js!

This is mostly showing the backend system of the website to show what I have completed so far. I will continue to make changes until the website is done!
